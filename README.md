### Garage-devs

## Project Description


  - Garage-devs is web application designed to put groups of emerging game devs together it is a place where you can put up your own work no matter how terrible it is. from there others can see what you've put up and could connect to you for collaboration. The site needs to be able to store and retrieve files of many types as well as work as a organization platform form for burgeoning projects.

## Problem Statement

  -  For all the sub-par stories, redundant game-play elements, and style over substance driven design there's something captivating about a good game. A good game isn't a just great game-play, or an intriguing style, or even a wonderful story a good game blends elements of all of these mediums perfectly. Knowing this its easy to see how so many games fall short it takes a group of people each with their own unique skillets to make something amazing, but most game-devs start off by making games all by their lonesome which can be daunting and a misrepresentation of how triple A games are made. Making a game is a lot like making music, like music needs a band of people with diverse tastes and skills so does a game and bands need a place to start and like a Dave Grohl says "a place to suck". Garage-devs is that place its a place for a "band" to form and suck together each person just doing what they love each on they're own journey and once in a while make something amazing.

## Map the user experience

  - Mook is a writer, however unlike most of his peers he loves to write in the second person. Mook doesn't know what what todo with his writing but he learns about Garage-devs from a friend, He doesn't know much about coding but a video game is the best place to work on his skills of making a compelling story that someone moves through. So he through his writing on garage-devs and joins a "band" his writing is coming to life unlike anything he could've imagined before.

  - Emily is in love with FPS's she loves the endorphin rush she feels when she scores an elimination she thinks the games she play lack "something", so she learns Unity and makes super responsive and engaging shooter mechanics but shes shooting blocks at blocks. 3-d modeling seems hard to get anything that looks good and she doesn't have the patience todo it so she uploads her blocks-shooting-blocks game to garage-devs looking for someone to collaborate with when she forms a "band" with a few other people, her shooting mechanics become the core of an game. She learns from her experiences and continues to make game-play that appeals to her.

  - Minion is a 3-d modeler, he spends hours upon hours making things he's proud of and he wants to see them come to life but he's not confident that he could, he uploads his models to Garage-devs as an afterthought thinking no one will like them, but to his surprise someone contacts him and wants to collaborate Minion now makes models that not only he's proud of but that he gets to see come to life.
